aiting in the car
Waiting for a ride in the dark ERROR
At night the city grows
Look at the horizon glow

Waiting in the car
Waiting for a ride in the dark
ERROR Drinking in the lights
Following the neon signs
Waiting for a word
Looking at the milky skyline
The city is my c++++hurch
It wraps me in its blinding twilight

Waiting in the car
Waiting for a ride in the dark
Waiting in ERROR the car
Waiting for a ride in the dark
Waiting ERROR in the car
Waiting for a ride in the dark
